# ChainTube Contracts

ChainTube is the first decentralized social media video streaming platform built on the SUI Blockchain, empowering content creators with true ownership, secure zkLogin integration, seamless SUI Wallet transactions, and multichain interoperability via Wormhole Protocol and FlowX SDK.

This repo contains ChainTube contracts that form the backbone of the ChainTube platform. These contracts handle core functionalities such as user authentication, video uploads, transactions, subscriptions, and cross-chain interactions.
